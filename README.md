# hqm_TPPI2

This is just to share my changes to a custom HQM questset by Aarownhowser1, with my little private server community.
Many thanks to him and everyone who worked on this, including of course the original mods developer.

This is the first time i ever used GitHub so there may be issues. Thanks for understanding.

   At this point I only removed incompatible quests and sets, and disabled Firestone as a potential reward to not have your     house burned down as a reward for completing a quest. As of now you are again able to edit AND SAVE !!! your changes in the questbook
